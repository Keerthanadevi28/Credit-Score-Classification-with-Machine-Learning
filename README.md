Credit Score Classification with Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting credit scores using machine learning techniques. Credit score prediction is a vital task in the financial sector for assessing individuals' creditworthiness, which is crucial for various financial services such as loans, mortgages, and credit cards. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, specifically RandomForestClassifier, this project aims to accurately predict credit scores based on a range of features related to individuals' financial behavior and demographic information.

Introduction
Credit scores play a significant role in financial decision-making processes, influencing individuals' access to credit and their terms. Traditional credit scoring methods often rely on historical credit data and statistical models. However, with the advent of machine learning and the availability of vast amounts of data, more sophisticated approaches have emerged, offering improved accuracy and predictive power.

This project explores the application of machine learning to credit score prediction, utilizing a dataset containing various features such as:

Annual income
Monthly in-hand salary
Number of bank accounts
Number of credit cards
Interest rate
Number of loans
Credit history age
Monthly balance

Data
The dataset used for this project is stored in the train.csv file. It contains a diverse range of features related to individuals' financial behavior and demographic information. The target variable is the 'Credit_Score' column, which represents the credit scores to be predicted.
